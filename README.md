Project Title:Predictive Modeling of Thermal Behavior in PMSM using Machine Learning

Problem Statement:Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are widely used in electric vehicles and industrial applications. Excessive temperature rise can reduce motor efficiency, damage insulation, and shorten motor lifespan. Direct temperature measurement using sensors is costly and not always reliable during operation.

Purpose / Objective: The purpose of this project is to predict the temperature of a PMSM motor using machine learning based on torque input. This helps in early detection of overheating conditions, improves motor safety, and reduces the need for complex temperature sensors.

solution approach:
*Use machine learning to predict temperature
*Use torque input as the main parameter
*Apply Linear Regression model
*Predict motor temperature from torque values
Classify temperature into: Low → Safe,Medium → Warning,High → Danger

Methodology:
*Collected PMSM operational data including torque and temperature
*Preprocessed and analyzed the dataset
*Trained a Linear Regression model using torque as input
*Predicted motor temperature from the trained model
*Classified the predicted temperature into Low, Medium, and High levels

Results:
*Successfully predicted PMSM temperature using torque input
*Enabled early identification of overheating conditions
*Improved motor monitoring without direct temperature sensing
*Helped in preventing efficiency loss and motor damage

Applications
*Electric Vehicles (EVs)
*Industrial motor drives
*Condition monitoring of electric motors

Key Skills Used:
*Machine Learning
*Linear Regression
*Python
*Data Analysis
*Electric Machines (PMSM)
